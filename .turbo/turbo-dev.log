 ⚠ Warning: Next.js inferred your workspace root, but it may not be correct.
 We detected multiple lockfiles and selected the directory of /Users/jacob/package-lock.json as the root directory.
 To silence this warning, set `turbopack.root` in your Next.js config, or consider removing one of the lockfiles if it's not needed.
   See https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbopack#root-directory for more information.

(node:50893) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///Users/jacob/Downloads/split-main%202/packages/ui/tailwind.config.ts is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /Users/jacob/Downloads/split-main 2/packages/ui/package.json.
